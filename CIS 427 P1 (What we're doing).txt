Buy Functionality Testing
We need to test a few things
1 - We need to test buying a card that doesn't exist
2 - We need to test buying a card at a price that exceeds our wallet
3 - We need to test buying a card we already have
4 - We need to test buying more cards than exist
5 - We need to test buying only partial card stock (i.e. if 2 cards exist buy only 1)
6 - We need to test buying all of card stock (i.e. if 2 cards exist buy 2)

On each test where a database modification is done make sure to query for all of the table data and print it to
verify the results are as expected

How to run the server and client so we can test
1 - Need Python installed and need to make sure your PATH variables include the path to python 
This video can be referred to for installation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCY4D9n3Pew&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge
A restart may be required
2 - After installing verify it is correctly installed by opening cmd and running "python --version" 
if it is installed and properly set in your PATH variable it will respond with a version
otherwise it will say "command unrecognized"
3 - Open root project folder in vs code
4 - After that in VS Code select "Terminal" from the top utility bar and select "New Terminal" 
5 - Open 2 terminals
5 - In one terminal make sure you are in root project folder (i.e. you should have client.py and server.py listed
if you type "pwd" command)
6 - Once you verify you are in root project directory type "python server.py" in one terminal 
7 - In the other type "python client.py"

DEBUGGING
If you want to debug you can only debug the server or the client at a time you cannot do both at once.
Server - 
1 - When you are in your server.py select "Run" from the top utility bar. 
2 - Select "Run & Debug"
3 - Open a new terminal
4 - Making sure you are in root project directory run "python client.py"

Client -
1 - Open a new terminal
2 - Making sure you are in root project directory run "python server.py"
3 - Select client.py file in vs code file explorer or from your file tab 
4 - Select "Run" from the top utility bar
5 - Select "Run & Debug"

How to stop your client or server when running it from terminal 
1 - Select the terminal where your server or client is running 
2 - Click inside of the terminal 
3 - Press Ctrl + "C"
If done correctly you should get some sort of output that indicates that your client or server is closed

Some potential hiccups 
When you select "Run & Debug" you might be asked to select a debugger. Just select python option and it should be
straight forward from there

If you close your server and client and try to run them sometimes you will get the error that "Address/ Port is already binded"
This indicates that the Port/ Address is already in use. To fix stop client and server from running and change 
the PORT variable in both client.py and server.py. Save both files and retry.
